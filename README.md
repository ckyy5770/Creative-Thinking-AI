AI project 2
--2016.12

## Brief description

The goal of this project is to build an AI system that could
complete creativity task(Kim, 2006): generate different drawings
using some simple shapes as the starting point. For example,
if I give a circle and a triangle to the system as input,
the system should return some creative drawings that only using
circles and triangles as basic elements. However, the size
and number of those circles and triangles could be vary in
order to form a meaningful image.
